## 🌐 Project 2: Build, Secure, and Protect a Web Application

Designed, secured, and deployed a personal cybersecurity blog hosted as a cloud-based web application.

**Project Components:**
- Deployed the application in a cloud environment.
- Implemented protections against common vulnerabilities (e.g., input validation, HTTPS).
- Documented the process with screenshots, the live URL, and technical writeups.

## 📊 Project 3: Building a Security Monitoring Environment

Established a customized security monitoring system using **Splunk** for a fictional organization.

**Highlights:**
- Configured data inputs and collected relevant security logs.
- Built custom dashboards and alerting rules to detect simulated threats.
- Demonstrated detection and response strategies.

## 📱 Project 4: Mobile Forensics Uncovered

Performed digital forensics on a fictional iPhone case using **Autopsy** in **Kali Linux**.

**Tasks Included:**
- Analyzed SMS messages for evidence correlation.
- Extracted media files (e.g., `.HEIC`, `.MOV`) and analyzed EXIF data.
- Compiled a final case report detailing investigative findings.

## 🧨 Project 5: Penetration Test Report

Conducted a simulated penetration test targeting a fictional organization's:

- Web Applications  
- Linux Servers  
- Windows Servers  

**Deliverables:**
- Identified and exploited multiple vulnerabilities.
- Collected evidence through screenshots and logs.
- Produced a comprehensive remediation-focused penetration testing report.

## 🛠️ Project 6: Splunk-Based SOC for Vandalay Industries

Acted as a **Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst** using Splunk to protect Vandalay Industries.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- **DDoS Analysis:** Evaluated impact on network performance using speed ratios.
- **Vulnerability Management:** Analyzed Nessus scans and set up alerting on critical findings.
- **Brute Force Detection:** Monitored login attempts and identified brute-force patterns.

Developed custom dashboards and detection alerts to help secure the environment proactively.

## 🧪 Project 7: Web Application Vulnerability Testing

Acted as an Application Security Engineer to identify and exploit common web application flaws using tools like **Burp Suite** and **BeEF**.

**Areas Covered:**
- **Command Injection:** Extracted sensitive files and proposed mitigations.
- **Broken Authentication/Brute Force:** Used Burp Intruder to reveal weak login mechanisms.
- **XSS + BeEF:** Executed stored XSS to inject BeEF hooks and demonstrate client-side exploitation techniques (e.g., phishing simulations, info gathering).

All findings were documented with screenshots and practical remediation strategies.
