# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my cybersecurity projects repository. This collection demonstrates my hands-on experience with a variety of cybersecurity domains including penetration testing, digital forensics, web application security, SOC analysis, and cloud-based monitoring.

Each project includes a comprehensive PDF report that outlines objectives, tools, methodologies, outcomes, and mitigation strategies.
