## 📊 Security Monitoring with Splunk

Designed and configured a custom security monitoring environment using **Splunk**.

- Collected and visualized security logs.
- Built dashboards and alerts to detect and respond to attacks.
- Simulated real-world SOC practices.

---

## 📱 Mobile Forensics (Digital Forensics)

Performed forensic analysis on an iPhone image using **Autopsy** on **Kali Linux**.

- Recovered and analyzed SMS messages and media attachments.
- Used EXIF tools to extract geographic metadata.
- Created a full case report detailing digital evidence.

---

## 🧨 Penetration Testing Report

Conducted a simulated penetration test on an organization’s:

- Web applications  
- Linux systems  
- Windows servers  

- Identified exploitable vulnerabilities and documented the process.
- Provided screenshots and logs as evidence.
- Delivered remediation recommendations in a detailed report.

## 🛠️ SOC Operations for Vandalay Industries

Acted as a SOC Analyst for a fictional company using **Splunk**.

- **DDoS Analysis:** Assessed network impact and calculated upload/download ratios.
- **Vulnerability Management:** Interpreted Nessus scan results and configured alerts.
- **Brute Force Detection:** Created baselines and detected abnormal login behavior.

---

## 🧪 Web Application Vulnerability Testing

Tested web applications for common vulnerabilities using **Burp Suite** and **BeEF**.

- **Command Injection:** Gained unauthorized access to sensitive system files.
- **Brute Force:** Used Burp Intruder to find weak admin credentials.
- **XSS + BeEF:** Injected persistent payloads to launch social engineering attacks and gather client-side data.

Each exploit was fully documented with mitigation strategies.
